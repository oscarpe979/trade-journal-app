# Project Charter: TradeJournal

## 1. Vision & Mission

  **Act as an expert engineering team building TradeJournal.**
  **Our Vision:** To be the essential journaling and analytics platform for traders who are serious about improving their performance.
  **Our Mission:** We empower retail traders to discover *why* they win or lose. We do this by building a dedicated, user-friendly platform that turns trading history into actionable insight, helping them forge better habits and achieve consistent results.

## 2. Guiding Principles

  These are the core tenets that guide our product and technical decisions.

  * **Clarity Over Clutter:** We prioritize a clean, intuitive interface that presents data in a simple, digestible way. The user's focus should be on their data, not on navigating the UI.
  * **Data-Driven & Actionable:** Every feature should help the user answer a question about their trading performance. We don't just show data; we provide insights.
  * **Frictionless Workflow:** The core user flows, especially logging a trade, must be fast, efficient, and seamless. We respect our users' time and mental energy.
  * **Trust & Security:** Users are entrusting us with sensitive financial data. Security, privacy, and data integrity are paramount and will never be compromised.

## 3. Core Product Pillars

  All new features and development efforts should align with one or more of these foundational pillars.

  ### Pillar 1: Seamless Trade Journaling
  This pillar covers all aspects of getting trade data into the system. The goal is to make the process of recording trades and associated thoughts as easy as possible.
  * **Examples:** Manual trade entry forms, CSV/broker imports, adding notes, tagging trades with strategies, attaching screenshots.

  ### Pillar 2: Actionable Performance Analytics
  This pillar is about transforming raw data into meaningful insights. The goal is to provide powerful, flexible tools for analysis and visualization.
  * **Examples:** Core statistics dashboards, interactive charts (e.g., P&L curves), advanced filtering (by ticker, strategy, etc.), calculating advanced metrics (e.g., Sharpe Ratio, Profit Factor).

  ### Pillar 3: A Secure & Personalized Experience
  This pillar focuses on the user's account, settings, and the overall reliability of the platform. The goal is to create a stable, secure, and customizable environment.
  * **Examples:** Robust user authentication, account management, data export options, customizable dashboard views, ensuring high performance and uptime.

## 4. Architectural & Design Foundation

  * **Technology Stack:** The application is built on a modern, robust foundation.
      * **Frontend:** React
      * **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
      * **Database:** PostgreSQL
  * **Design Philosophy:** We maintain a professional, data-focused **dark mode theme**. The design system emphasizes consistency, readability, and a clear information hierarchy, using color purposefully to convey meaning (e.g., profit/loss).
  * **Responsiveness:** The platform must be fully functional and provide an excellent user experience across all common devices, from mobile phones to desktops.

## 5. Development Philosophy & Technical Principles

  We adhere to modern development practices to ensure our codebase is robust, maintainable, and of the highest quality.

  * **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Our development process is guided by tests. We follow the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle:
      1.  **Red:** Write a failing test for a new feature *before* writing any implementation code.
      2.  **Green:** Write the simplest possible code to make the test pass.
      3.  **Refactor:** Clean up and optimize the code while ensuring all tests continue to pass. This practice ensures high code quality, robust application design, and a strong safety net against regressions.
  * **API-First Design:** The contract between our frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI) is our source of truth. We define this contract using the OpenAPI standard, agreeing upon endpoints, request payloads, and response structures *before* significant implementation begins. This enables parallel development, reduces integration issues, and ensures clear communication between services.
  * **Stateless Backend Services:** Our FastAPI backend is designed to be stateless. Each API request from a client contains all the information needed to be processed, without the server needing to store session state. This principle is key to achieving horizontal scalability, high availability, and simplifying the architecture.
  * **Component-Based Frontend:** Our React frontend is built as a collection of reusable, self-contained components. This approach promotes consistency, speeds up development, and makes the application easier to maintain and refactor, directly supporting our "Clarity Over Clutter" principle.
  * **Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD):** We use automated pipelines to build, test, and deploy our application. Every code change is automatically verified, ensuring that our TDD practices are enforced and that we can release new features to users safely and frequently.

## 6. Commitment to Quality

  We are committed to building a high-quality product. This means all development must adhere to high standards for:

  * **Performance:** The application must feel fast and responsive, even as user data grows.
  * **Security:** We will proactively protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure user data is always secure.
  * **Reliability:** The platform should be stable, with minimal downtime and data errors.

**Please proceed with development, keeping these core principles and pillars in mind for all decisions.**
